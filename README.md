## Experiment 1
Design and Simulation of Inverting Amplifier using Op-Amp (μA741) in Proteus
## Aim
To design and simulate an Inverting Amplifier using μA741 Op-Amp in Proteus Design Suite and verify the voltage gain experimentally.
## Apparatus / Components Required
S.No	Component	Specification	Quantity
1	Op-Amp IC	μA741	1
2	Resistor R1	10 kΩ	1
3	Resistor Rf	100 kΩ	1
4	Signal Generator	Sine wave, 1 kHz	1
5	Dual DC Power Supply	+15V, -15V	1
6	CRO / Oscilloscope	Virtual (Proteus)	1
7	Connecting Wires	—	As required
## Theory
An Inverting Amplifier is a closed-loop amplifier configuration where the input signal is applied to the inverting terminal (-) of the op-amp through resistor R1, and feedback resistor Rf is connected between output and inverting terminal.
The non-inverting terminal (+) is grounded.
## Circuit Description
•	Pin 2 → Inverting input
•	Pin 3 → Non-inverting input (Grounded)
•	Pin 6 → Output
•	Pin 7 → +15V
•	Pin 4 → -15V
The input sine wave is applied through R1 and output is taken from pin 6.
